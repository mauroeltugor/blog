        <h1>Feeling</h1>
        <p>Feelings are subjective self-contained phenomenal experiences.
            According to the APA Dictionary of Psychology, a feeling is
            "a self-contained phenomenal experience"; <br> and feelings are "subjective,
            evaluative, and independent of the sensations, thoughts, or images evoking them"
            The term feeling is closely related to, but not the same as emotion. <br> "Feeling"
            may for instance refer to the conscious subjective experience of emotions.
            The study of subjective experiences is referred to as phenomenology. <br>
            The discipline of psychotherapy generally involves a therapist helping a
            client understand, articulate and learn to effectively regulate their own
            feelings and ultimately <br> take responsibility for their experience of the world.
            Feelings are sometimes held to be characteristic of embodied consciousness.</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The modern conception of affect developed in the 19th century with Wilhelm Wundt.
            The word comes from the German Gefühl, meaning “feeling.”
            A number of experiments have been conducted in the study of social and
            psychological affective preferences (i.e., what people like or dislike).
            Specific research has been done on preferences, attitudes, impression formation,
            decision-making. This research contrasts findings with recognition memory
            (old-new judgments), allowing researchers to demonstrate reliable distinctions
            between the two. Affect-based judgments and cognitive processes have been examined
            with noted differences indicated, and some argue affect and cognition are under the

            control of separate and partially independent systems that can influence each other
            in a variety of ways (Zajonc, 1980). </p>

        <h1>Perception</h1>
        <p>The way that we see other people express their emotions or feelings determines how we respond.
            The way an individual responds to a situation is based on feeling rules. If an individual
            is uninformed about a situation the way they respond would be in a completely different demeanor
            than if they were informed about a situation. For example, if a tragic event had occurred and they
            had knowledge of it, their response would be sympathetic to that situation. If they had no knowledge
            of the situation, then their response may be indifference. A lack of knowledge or information about
            an event can shape the way an individual sees things and the way they respond.</p>

        <h1>Needs</h1>
        <p>A need is something required to sustain a healthy life
            (e.g. air, water, food). A (need) deficiency causes a clear adverse outcome:
            a dysfunction or death. Abraham H. Maslow, pointed out that satisfying (i.e., gratification of)
            a need, is just as important as deprivation (i.e., motivation to satisfy), for it releases the
            focus of the satisfied need, to other emergent needs</p>
        <h3>For example</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>motivation</li>
            <p>Motivation is what explains why people or animals initiate,
                continue or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time.
                Motivational states are commonly understood as forces acting within
                the agent that create a disposition to engage in goal-directed behavior.
                It is often held that different mental states compete with each other and
                that only the strongest state determines behavior.</p>
            <li>Valence</li>
            <p>Valence tells organisms (e.g., humans) how well or how bad an organism is doing
                (in relation to the environment), for meeting the organism's needs</p>
        </ul>
